- create SAuth::Consumer::Perisistent
    - it should just after the access_grant accessor method
      and save it to disk if need be

- SAuth::Web::Provider::AuthMiddleware
    - we are checking most of hte 401 errors, but still need to check
        - SAuth::Core::Error::KeyNotFound
        - SAuth::Core::Error::InvalidKey

- SAuth::Web::Consumer::Client
    - the whole retry after 502 stuff is wrong
        - we might need to add it to the other operations
          though if it persists
    - should we extract the nonce from the 401 errors??
    - should we clear the nonce if we don't get one back??
